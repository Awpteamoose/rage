Web frontend experiments in the rust age.

## todo?
### better event handling
* one handler for every kind of event on the root
* generate id for each rendered dom node
* on event, match id to relevant vdom elevent and trigger the actual callback, react-style
* 40% speedup
### keep typecast DomElement next to DomNode
